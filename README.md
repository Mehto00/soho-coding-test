## SOHO coding test

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Hopefully you have access to the *available.json* -file. You have add it to **src/asset** directory before getting to spectate the desirable results.

## Install

    git clone git@github.com:Mehto00/html5-test.git
    cd html5-test
    npm install

## Start & watch

    npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Simple build for production

    npm run build

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

If you wish to have more information about the build see the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) from the Create React App documentation.
